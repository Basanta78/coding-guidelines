#### The following convention should be followed for `class` naming:

### Classes

* Avoid inbuilt names.
* Classes/Components/Interfaces names should always be `PascalCase` and `noun`. i.e. `TaskService`, `Interceptor`, `Evaluation`
* Describe the class resposibility in name.
* Custom Exceptions should always be named ending with `Error` or `Exception` i.e. `ValidationError` , `ValidationException`

  ```js
  class SoftwareDeveloper {
    constructor(firstName, lastName) {
      this.firstName = firstName;
      this.lastName = lastName;
    }
  }

  const me = new SoftwareDeveloper('John', 'Doe');
  ```

### Components

* Components are commonly found in frontend frameworks like React/Polymer/Vue. Since a component is kinda instantiated -- but appended to the DOM instead -- like a JavaScript class, they are widely declared with `PascalCase` and `noun` too.

  ```js
  // bad
  function userProfile(user) {
    return (
      <div>
        <span>First Name: {user.firstName}</span>
        <span>Last Name: {user.lastName}</span>
      </div>
    );
  }

  // good
  function UserProfile(user) {
    return (
      <div>
        <span>First Name: {user.firstName}</span>
        <span>Last Name: {user.lastName}</span>
      </div>
    );
  }
  ```

When a component gets used, it distinguishes itself from native HTML and web components, because its first letter is always written in uppercase.

  ```jsx
  <UserProfile user={{ firstName: 'John', lastName: 'Doe' }}/>
  ```
