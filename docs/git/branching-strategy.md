* The main branches should be created as required and should follow the hierarchy should be `master`<-`uat`<-`qa`<-`dev`.
* Every feature, task is done in a separate branch <b>named according to the JIRA issue name</b>.
* Any critical bug after production release is done via hotfix branches. It is branched off from `master` and <b>merged back to master and dev after itâ€™s done</b>.
