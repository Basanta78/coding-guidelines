#### Best Practices:

* Pull Request should atleast be <b>reviewed by 1 person</b> before merging it to the base branch.
* Only comment author can resolve comment – if code was corrected or after discussion author decides to fix it.
* Don’t mention the same problem many times. Don’t bloat the code, say it once and ask to fix everywhere.
* If there are pending, not resolved comments, the assignee is a code author who should fix or comment back.
* If there are discussions commented by the code author, the assignee is reviewer, who should continue a discussion or resolve comments and approve.
* Use labels to mark what actions should be next – e.g. `needs review`, `Reviewed By... ` etc.
* Provide details/screenshots about what has been changed.
