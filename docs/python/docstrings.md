## Introduction

> Code is more often read than written - Guido Van Rossum

A few lines of description written on top of a function can save
the coder or a future developer hours or time reading the code.

**Docstrings** are documentation that is written along with the code.
There are different typs of docstrings in Python:

- Class
- Class methods
- Package
- Modules
- Functions
- Script

### Comments are not docstrings

While comments are also written alongside code, docstrings are different
from comments. While comments start with a '#' symbol, docstrings are
also enclosed withing triple double quotes """This is a docstring""".
The placement of docstrings is also crucial. Docstrings placed arbitrarily
may simply be construed as a comment

To illustrate this try the following in the python console

```python
class Test:
   """This is a class docstring"""

   def example_method():
       """This is a method docstring
       """
       pass

   def example_method_2():
       # This is a comment
       pass
```

```python
> print(Test.__doc___)
This is a class docstring
>
> print(Test.example_method.__doc__)
This is a method docstring
>
> print(Test.example_method_2.__doc__)
None
```

As you can see from the examples above, docstrings get
attached to the `__doc__` property of the code itself whereas,
the comments do not.

### Usage of docstrings

From the console, you can use docstrings to an overview of
code as follows:

```python
> help(Test)
Help on class Test in module __main__:

class Test(builtins.object)
 |  This is a class docstring
 |
 |  Methods defined here:
 |
 |  example_method()
 |      This is a method docstring
 |
 |  example_method_2()


```

If a docstring is provided, you can get more readable
information about python code.

** They are also used by your IDE to give you information while developing.**

Furthermore, there are tools that can take this to the
next level by creating a static website of documentation
for your code:

- [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/)
- [Epydoc](http://epydoc.sourceforge.net/)
- [Read the docs](https://readthedocs.org/)
- [Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual/docblocks.html#pythonblocks)
- [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/)
- [Pycco](https://pycco-docs.github.io/pycco/)


## Conventions

The following sections describe the conventions that are recommended by Leapfrog

### Python's official standard

The PEPs are considered to be the official standard for Python. The following sections
talk specifically about docstring and we recommend that you read them

- [PEP-256 -- Docstring Conventions](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/#specification) (**Must Read**)
- [PEP-8 Comments Section](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#comments)
- [PEP 287 reStructedText Docstring Format](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0287/)

### Docstring template selection

While you can write anything between the triple quotes(""") to
write your docstring, it is generally recommended to follow a
template for consistency and also for libraries to be able to
parse your docstring easily.

The official documentation standard for Python is ReStructed Text docstrings ([PEP 287](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0287/)).
However, Google docstrings have been widely accepted by the community as such we recommend it as we find it more readable and pythonic.
If you're using using Numpy related libraries, you should be using Numpy Docstrings

- [Google docstrings](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/pyguide.md#38-comments-and-docstrings) (**Recommended**)
- [reStructured Text Docstrings](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html) (Seen in many inbuilt python libraries.)
- [Numpy Docstrings](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html) (**Recommended for AI projects**)

### Where to add docstrings

The developers should add docstrings in the following locations

- At the start of every Python file
- At the beginning of every class
- After each function declaration
- At the beginning of the `__init__.py` file for Module/Package documentation
- In their tests to describe what they are testing.

### What to not miss

Use the documentation template of your choice and try not to miss the following
in the docstrings

- A brief description of the entity that is being documented (**Mandatory**)
- Follow the above by above by examples and implementation details (**Recommended**)
- Add typing information where things can get confusing (**Recommended**). As python is a
dynamically typed language, adding some type definition to the documentation can save
the developers a lot of debugging time
- Autodeploy the documentation site using a static deployment tool
to check that your docstrings render correctly

### Checking Docstring coverage

- Use [pydocstyle](https://pydocstyle.pycqa.org/en/latest/) for linting your code against docstrings. When using `flake8`, [this](https://gitlab.com/pycqa/flake8-docstrings) plugin can be used.
- [interrogate](https://interrogate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (example below) is **recommended** to use for docstring coverage in the code.

### Examples

#### Google Docstrings (recommended)

```python

"""Example Google style docstrings.

This module demonstrates documentation as specified by the `Google Python
Style Guide`_. Docstrings may extend over multiple lines. Sections are created
with a section header and a colon followed by a block of indented text.

Example:
    Examples can be given using either the ``Example`` or ``Examples``
    sections. Sections support any reStructuredText formatting, including
    literal blocks::

        $ python example_google.py

Section breaks are created by resuming unindented text. Section breaks
are also implicitly created anytime a new section starts.

Attributes:
    module_level_variable1 (int): Module level variables may be documented in
        either the ``Attributes`` section of the module docstring, or in an
        inline docstring immediately following the variable.

        Either form is acceptable, but the two should not be mixed. Choose
        one convention to document module level variables and be consistent
        with it.

Todo:
    * For module TODOs
    * You have to also use ``sphinx.ext.todo`` extension

#### ReStructured Text Doc strings

You can see this kind of docstring especially in python libraries.
Please use **Google** style as they are more readable.

```python
"""The method below prints a given string twice

The print method has been called twice for
implementing this method

:param param1: String that is to be printed
:type param1: str
:return: Length of the input string
:rtype: int
"""
def print_twice(param1):
    print(param1)
    print(param1)

    return len(param1)

"""The method below prints a given string twice. This is for type annotation.

The print method has been called twice for
implementing this method

:param str param1: String that is to be printed
:return: Length of the input string
:rtype: int
"""
def print_twice(param1: str) -> int:
    print(param1)
    print(param1)

    return len(param1)
```

## Doctests

:::caution
While this should not be used for all checks and [testing](testing.md) should be followed. They can be used for simple parameter checking. i.e. some default case like module level doctest in example below.

They can be used with [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/doctest.html) as well.
:::

Python provides tests through docstrings which can be leveraged by [doctests](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html).

Example

```python
"""
This is the "example" module.

The example module supplies one function, factorial().  For example,

>>> factorial(5)
120
"""

def factorial(n):
    """Return the factorial of n, an exact integer >= 0.

    >>> [factorial(n) for n in range(6)]
    [1, 1, 2, 6, 24, 120]
    >>> factorial(30)
    265252859812191058636308480000000
    >>> factorial(-1)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    ValueError: n must be >= 0

    Factorials of floats are OK, but the float must be an exact integer:
    >>> factorial(30.1)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    ValueError: n must be exact integer
    >>> factorial(30.0)
    265252859812191058636308480000000

    It must also not be ridiculously large:
    >>> factorial(1e100)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    OverflowError: n too large
    """

    import math
    if not n >= 0:
        raise ValueError("n must be >= 0")
    if math.floor(n) != n:
        raise ValueError("n must be exact integer")
    if n+1 == n:  # catch a value like 1e300
        raise OverflowError("n too large")
    result = 1
    factor = 2
    while factor <= n:
        result *= factor
        factor += 1
    return result


if __name__ == "__main__":
    import doctest
    doctest.testmod()
```

This can be tested with:

```bash
$ python example.py -v
```
